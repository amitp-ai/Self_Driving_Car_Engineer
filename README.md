# Self Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree
This repository contains my project submissions for Udacity's self driving car nanodegree. 

The Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree is an online certification intended to prepare students to become self-driving car engineers. The program was developed by Udacity in partnership with Mercedes-Benz, NVIDIA, Uber ATG, amongst others.

## Program Outline:


## Term 1: Computer Vision and Deep Learning (Started Oct 2016)
**Computer Vision**
* Project 1: Finding Lane Lines (Intro to Computer Vision): Introductory project which used basic computer vision techniques like canny edge and hough transforms to detect lane lines
* Project 4: Advanced Lane Lines (Computer Vision): Use of image thresholding, warping and fitting lanes lines to develop a more robust method of detecting lane lines on a road
* Project 5: Vehicle Detection (Computer Vision): Use of HOG and SVM to detect vehicles on a road

**Deep Learning**
* Project 2: Traffic Sign Classifier (Deep Learning) - Use TensorFlow to train a convolution neural network capable of detecting road side traffic signs.
* Project 3: Behavioral Cloning (Deep Learning): Train a car to drive in a 3D simulator using a deep neural network. 


## Term 2: Sensor Fusion, Localization, and Control (Started Feb 2017)
**Sensor Fusion**
* Projects 1 and 2: Combine lidar and radar data to track objects in the environment using Kalman filters (both Extended and Unscented Kalman Filters (EKF and UKF)

**Localization**
* Project 3: Locate a car relative to the world map. Use a particle filter to localize the vehicle.

**Control**
* Project 4: Use PID control to steer the car as well as adjust brake/acceleration inorder to follow a reference trajectory.
* Project 5: Use MPC to develop a more advanced controller that even handled hardware response delays.


## Term 3: Path Planning, Semantic Segmentation, System Integration (Started May 2017)
**Path Planning**
* Project 1: Generate a smooth trajectory (as well as proper speed) to navigate the vehicle on a highway while avoiding obstacles and other vehicles. Additionally, finding a sequence of steps in a maze (navigating cities, parking lots, etc)

**Semantic Segmentation**
* Project 2: Using FCN based semantic segmentation architecture to classify each pixel in the image into road, car, or everything else category.

**Capstone Project**
* Project 3: A system integration team project to run on a real self-driving car. My task was to develop a traffic light detection module using SSD. The network would output the location of the traffic light (bounding box) as well as the traffic light state (red, green, yellow, or not working).
